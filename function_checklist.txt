1. Did you start your function with 'def'?
2. Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
3. Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after your function name?
4. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?
5. Did you make each argument unique (meaning to duplicated names)?
6. Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ): after the arguments?
7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less.
8. Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent ('dedenting' we call it)?

And when I run ("use" or "call") a function, I should check these things:

1. Did I call/use/run this function by typing its name?
2. Did I put the ( character after the name to run it?
3. Did I put the values I want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
4. Did I end the function call with a ) character?
